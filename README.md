# The Forbidden Number 
js13k attendee for year 2024. Game theme is triskaidekaphobia, fear of number 13.

The game involves clicking on numbers with the mouse, but you must avoid clicking on the number 13.
The goal is to click on as many numbers as possible without selecting 13. When all other numbers
are clicked, new table is generated, and game gets slightly more difficult.


## Some details about this project
- Project uses webpack
- Graphics / texts are SVG generated with Inkscape.
- Tried to minimize file size, but roadroller minifier did not produce working code.
- In some parts, shortcuts had to be taken, and unfortunately, it shows in the final result.
- Initial version was made with Kontra.js, but I decided to do everything from scratch.

That's all. I hope you like this.

Cheers, Juhani.
